**Puzzle Board** is a base module intended for creating board puzzle games such as match-3, blast-3, tile match, connect dots, etc. which require board of pieces set in a specified grid layout (usually perpendicular) and collapsing pieces down if some of the pieces are removed from the board. This package provides these two mechanics, as well as allows extending it to any specific board puzzle game subgenre.
